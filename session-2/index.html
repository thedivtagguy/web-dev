# Its rewind time

The last session introduced to a lot of different things and today we'll revisit each of them in more detail. 

**1. HTML**
  - What is it? 
  - How do we write it?
  - Attributes and their differences
  
**2. CSS**
  - CSS properties
  - Selecting HTML elements
  
**3. Git**
  - Cloning files
  - Pushing to remote 

**4. Publishing online**

# HTML recap

### Identify the attributes in the following element
```html
&lt;p class="jean-luc" id="picard"&gt; Set phasers to stun &lt;/p&gt;
```
--
### What would be a better way of writing this?
```html
&lt;div class="riker"&gt; An Introduction to the Prime Directive &lt;/div&gt;
```
--
#### What is the purpose of the `&lt;section&gt;` tag?

---
# CSS Recap
#### How would I select the heading below?
```html
&lt;div id="enterprise"&gt;
  &lt;h1 class="worf"&gt;The Worf Effect&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```
--
#### What does the following look like?
.pull-left[
HTML
```html
&lt;div class="characters"&gt;
&lt;div id="elaine"&gt;
	&lt;h1 class="heading"&gt;I'm Queen of the castle&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="george"&gt;NEWMAN!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Nulla placerat sit amet justo in feugiat. Pellentesque facilisis tempus ipsum in congue. &lt;/p&gt;

 }
.characters {
 background-color: orange;

# CSS Selectors

Every HTML element you write should connect to some set of styles. There are **three main ways** of doing this. For example, for the following element: 

`&lt;h1 class="jesse" id="walter"&gt;Nothing but cows&lt;/h1&gt;`

I can select by type

--
```css
h1 {            /* Note how its just 'h1' */
font-size: 23px /* This makes all h1 23px */
}
```

--
Or by ID

```css
#walter {   /* IDs require a # */
color: red /* This makes all text with the walter ID red */
}
```
--
Or by...

So you have your HTML and you want to write some CSS for it. The first hurdle is learning how to **select** the element you want to style. 

CSS has *many* different ways of allowing you to select objects using **selectors**. It is important to get an understanding of this before we move further. 

Head over to [CSS Feast](https://flukeout.github.io/) and get started.

**There are 32 levels, but you only need to get till level 10-12.**

# Harry, Style it

I've created some dummy content with only HTML, some IDs and classes. Your task is to just fool around with CSS and make it look as ugly as you possibly can. 

[Find your code here](https://codepen.io/thedivtagguy/pen/ZErEper)

#### Time: 7 Minutes

# Learning Layouts

While HTML defines the content that goes in the page and gives it structure, CSS is what we use to create layouts and add all that jazz. 

CSS has two built in options to create all sorts of layouts:
  
  1. Flexbox 
  
  2. Grids

# Game time #2

To understand how flexbox works, we'll play a game called Flexbox Froggy. It sounds lame but hear me out:

Its got frogs. Lets play.

# Git 101

---

# Git vs. Github

**Git** is a software that helps you manage versions of your code. It helps you work solo or with people without having to manually interact with them. Which is great if you hate people.

**Github** is a platform where these versions can be stored. It also have a lot of features to enable people to work with each other which we will explore a little of.

### Github is to Git what Youtube is to videos.

---

# Git commands for this session

.pull-left[
1. `git clone`

2. `git init`

3. `git add`

4. `git commit` 

]

.pull-right[
5. `git push`

6. `git branch`

7. `git checkout`
]

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

There are two ways to interact with Git, one is with a GUI and the other is with the command line. The command line is a little harder but that is what we will use. 

Gotz to get those gains ðŸ’ª

# Activity 1 
## Writing HTML

---

class: middle, center

# I've written some plain text, can you add some HTML tags to make it more sensible?

---

# Step 1: Get the Activity File
## `git clone`

Git clone **copies** files from a location to your laptop. You'll use this for downloading files from Github and any other remote Git repositories. 

#### Syntax:

```js
git clone // &lt;-- paste a link of what you want to clone
```

For example, if you want to run a copy of any of the exercises in these slides, you'll write the following into the terminal: 

```js
git clone https://github.com/thedivtagguy/web-dev.git
```

---

# 1. Select the folder you want to clone into

.pull-left[
Go to `File` and select `Open Folder`. 

At this point, a file explorer should open. Select the folder you want to copy your files into.
]

.pull-right[

![:scale 50%](./images/gitclone1.png)
]

---

# 2. Clone

[Go to the repository and copy its URL.](https://github.com/thedivtagguy/session-1-activity-1) Then type this: 

```
git clone https://github.com/thedivtagguy/session-1-activity-1
```

![](./images/gitclone2.png)
##### Tip: If you make a mistake, use the UP or DOWN arrows to navigate history of what you typed into the terminal.
---

# Writing HTML

The file when you clone it will look like this but the [website looks nothing like it](https://webdev2.netlify.app/): 

![](./images/activity1.png)

Your job is to add relevant tags to make it look like a little more ordered.

# What you have right now is the master copy of the code. It is what will be published.

# We generally don't want to work live on the master copy, because what if something gets messed up and everyone suffers?

# Last time, we created a new repository for each of your submissions. This time, we'll update the current one itself.

# âœ¨  branches, baby  âœ¨ 
---

# What is a branch?

A branch is a copy of the main code. There can be a branch for each new feature, bug fix or a collaborator. 

With our repository, we'll do something like this: 

![](./images/branching.png)

---

# Branching

##  `git branch`

In your terminal, type this: 

```
git branch &lt; your name &gt;
```
--

This just created a new branch. There will be no changes in your code yet because everything looks the same. You're still on your master branch, so switch to the branch you just created by typing: 

```
git checkout &lt; your name, you sexy thing &gt;
```

--

With this, you're now on your branch ðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒ
---
class: middle, center, inverse

# Okay enough of Git. Write some HTML now. 

---
I've also included a cheatsheet in the [Github repository](https://github.com/thedivtagguy/session-2-activity-1). These are all the tags you'll need, with their syntax and links to more information. 

#### Time: 10 Minutes

# STOP IT

# Let us add some CSS to this

Try using CSS to style the contents of your practice file. In your "practice" folder, create a "css" folder and, and a "styles.css" file inside of it. Lastly, link that CSS file from the HTML file: 
```
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
```
--

Remember, you'll have to add classes or IDs to your tags to link it to the styles.

#### Time: 15 Minutes

# #Collab

The last bit of the process is to send this to Github. We're going to add you all as collaborators on this repository. 

To do this, add your Github username to the thread I just created on our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/srishtiwebdev).

---

# Ground Control to Major Tom

The process of **saving changes** to the remote, in this case our Github repository, is called pushing. Think of it like the upload button. 

--
### Add

Before you push your files, you need to let git know which files to push. To do this, use the `git add` command. 

You can either name the files you want to add, or just add all files that changed. This is done with the `-A` flag. 

--

Type the following into your terminal

```
git add -A
```
---
class: middle, left

### Commit
Next, we have to commit. Unless you are my ex, this should be easy.

Each commit is the **saved version** of your changes. It is always accompanied by a small message to remind you later of what you changed in this version. 

--

Commit your changes with a small message like so: 

```
git commit -m "Formatted HTML &amp; Created Branch"
```
---

# Hello friends, push kar lo

We are now ready to push from our laptop, which is the **origin**. 

The first time we push, it is important to let Git know that we're pushing it to the remote (also called **upstream**). This is done with the `-u` tag. 

--

We also need specify that what we are pushing is our current branch. Add all of this together and...  

--

...our complete command looks like this: 

```
git push -u origin &lt; your branch name &gt;
```
---

# Sweeeeeeet, lets check it out. 

As you know, we're using Netlify to host our websites. It pulls the code from our Github repository and builds it. Every time you update your code, your site updates too. 

Since we have uploaded our branches now, we should be able to see each branch live on our site. 

##### Our main URL is webdev2.netlify.app/

If your branch is named `harry`, you'll find your URL to be

```
harry--webdev2.netlify.app/
```
---
class: middle, left

# One more time

Quickly, change some text in your code. Just two words. 

And then commit changes again. To recap, your set of commands should be: 

```
git add -A
git commit -m "Update Text"
git push -u origin &lt;branch name&gt;
```
---

# Phew. Breathe.

# Quick Recap

You're now armed with the knowledge of:

1. Tags
2. CSS Selectors
3. CSS Flexbox
3. Developing in VS Code
4. Creating branches, pushing to Git
5. Deploying to Netlify

# Activity 2

You'll never be asked to design the abomination you made in the earlier activity. However, being asked to code a UI screen is extremely likely. If you're interested in developing the earlier skills further, here's a challenge.

## I've designed a product page in Figma and coded the bare, unstyled HTML for it. Can you apply CSS so that the HTML looks like the design file?

#### Files are at
```
https://github.com/thedivtagguy/activity2
```

---
background-image: url(images/design.png)
background-size: 1000px
background-position: 50% 50%

---
# To summarize the summary

1. Clone the repo on your machine
2. Look at the design and try to use your knowledge of CSS selectors and flexbox to recreate it

**Note:** You will still have to Google what other CSS properties you need to use. Ask questions like 'How do I make the buttons rounded?' or 'How do I change the font?' and Google them. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

3. Push your files to Github
4. Deploy this new repository to Netlify.
